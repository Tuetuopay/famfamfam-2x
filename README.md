In 2006 an amazing icon set was released that many of us have used for the last 6 years. But now, in 2012, we have the iPhone 4 & 4S, the new iPad and the MacBook Pro with Retina. These devices have amazing screens, and our favorite li'l icons that could be put everywhere now lookâ€¦ not so crisp.

# famfamfam@2x
700+ icons exist in the famfamfam set. This is no small feat to update to retina. I am starting with the ones I use in my applications. But in 2012 we have Github and social awesomeness that is way better than the MySpace days. So let's collaborate on this. Grab a couple icons out of the Silk icons set and make a high-quality @2x version, then fork this repo and send me a pull request.
